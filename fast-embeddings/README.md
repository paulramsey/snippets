<h1>Fast Embeddings</h1>

AlloyDB provides a very useful [embedding() function](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/ai/work-with-embeddings#embedding-generation) that creates embeddings directly in the database. However, this function does not always perform well when generating large batches of embeddings.

This notebook walks you through generating [Vertex AI embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/text-embeddings-api) for the AlloyDB database used by the [GenWealth Demo App](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/tree/main/gemini/sample-apps/genwealth). It uses the [Beam](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/examples/notebooks/beam-ml/data_preprocessing/vertex_ai_text_embeddings.ipynb) Direct Runner, which is suitable for testing and small ad hoc jobs. You can optionally use a DataFlow Runner for very large bounded and unbounded data sets. These techniques can significantly speed up the process of generating large batches of embeddings and storing them in AlloyDB vs using the native embedding() function.
